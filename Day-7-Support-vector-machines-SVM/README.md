# Day 7: Support Vector Machines (SVM) 🎯

## Overview
Support Vector Machines (SVM) is a powerful supervised learning algorithm for: 
- Binary and multi-class classification
- Regression (Support Vector Regression)
- Outlier detection
- High-dimensional data handling

## Why Learn SVM? 

✅ **Effective in high dimensions** - Works well with many features
✅ **Memory efficient** - Uses subset of training points (support vectors)
✅ **Versatile** - Linear, non-linear, and regression problems
✅ **Mathematically elegant** - Well-founded theory
❌ **Slower than trees** - Not ideal for very large datasets
❌ **Harder to interpret** - Black-box predictions

## What You'll Learn

1. **SVM Theory** - Margins, support vectors, optimization
2. **Kernel Methods** - Linear, RBF, Polynomial kernels
3. **From Scratch** - Implement SVM to understand internals
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning** - C, gamma, kernel selection
5. **Multi-class SVM** - Extend binary to multi-class
6. **Real-world Applications** - Iris, MNIST, spam detection
7. **Best Practices** - Common mistakes and optimization
