# Day 1: Feature Scaling

## Importance of Feature Scaling in Machine Learning

Feature scaling is a technique used to standardize the range of independent variables or features of data. In machine learning, it is crucial because:

- **Improved Convergence Speed**: Algorithms like gradient descent converge faster when features are on a similar scale.
- **Better Model Performance**: Many algorithms, such as k-nearest neighbors (KNN) and support vector machines (SVM), perform better when features are scaled.
- **Avoiding Bias**: When features have different ranges, the model may become biased towards features with larger ranges.

## Common Misconceptions

- **Misconception 1**: Feature scaling is only necessary for certain algorithms.
  - **Reality**: While some algorithms are more sensitive to feature scales, scaling can often improve performance across all models.
  
- **Misconception 2**: Normalization and standardization are the same.
  - **Reality**: Normalization typically refers to rescaling the data to a range of [0, 1], while standardization means centering the data around the mean with a standard deviation of 1.
